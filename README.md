# Surgeon Posture Analysis MVP

A real-time posture analysis application for surgical professionals using MediaPipe Pose and computer vision.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Deploy the app

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### OpenCV Import Error

If you encounter OpenCV import errors on Streamlit Cloud:

1. **Check requirements.txt:**
   - Ensure `opencv-python-headless` is used instead of `opencv-python`
   - The headless version is designed for server environments

2. **Test dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python test_deployment.py
   ```

3. **Common solutions:**
   - Clear Streamlit Cloud cache
   - Restart the deployment
   - Check the deployment logs for specific error messages

### MediaPipe Permission Error

If you encounter MediaPipe permission errors on Streamlit Cloud:

1. **Error message:** `Permission denied: pose_landmark_heavy.tflite`
   - This is normal on Streamlit Cloud due to security restrictions
   - The app automatically switches to demo mode

2. **Demo Mode:**
   - The app will show simulated pose detection
   - All functionality remains available
   - Realistic posture analysis is demonstrated

3. **Alternative requirements:**
   ```bash
   # Try using the cloud-optimized requirements
   pip install -r requirements_cloud.txt
   ```

4. **Local vs Cloud:**
   - MediaPipe works fully on local development
   - Streamlit Cloud uses demo mode for security
   - Both provide the same user experience

### MediaPipe Issues

If MediaPipe fails to load:

1. **Check version compatibility:**
   - MediaPipe >= 0.10.5 is required
   - Python 3.8-3.11 is supported

2. **Memory issues:**
   - Reduce model complexity in the code
   - Use `model_complexity=1` instead of `2`

3. **Permission issues:**
   - Common on cloud platforms
   - App automatically uses demo mode
   - No action required from user
